### Junior Data Engineer
**Python | Flask | API Design | SQL | Power BI | DBT | Git | Rust (learning)**

After 8 years of being in Advertising/Marketing, I decided to go to data first and then **to code** and stay there, because blending logic and creativity to solve meaningful problems is a celebration for my brain <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExem1zaDI5MHozaHpjaWE2ZDVreGVjbGY0YjFheTVpZWp1MW56aml0cSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/kaEPzm3xgCf1SpURYw/giphy.gif" width="40" /> 
**It is where all my skills finally come together.**

In advertising, I sharpened not just my eye, but my brain to develop a strong sense for **user needs** and an **analytical mindset**.  
And now, I’m here to build tools that are not just functional, but thoughtful and impactful.
